This build is optimized for Intel Macs and includes:
- ✅ **AVX/AVX2** - Advanced vector extensions for faster CPU processing
- ✅ **Accelerate framework** - Apple's optimized math library
- ✅ **F16C** - Half-precision floating point support
- ❌ No GPU acceleration (CPU only)

**Performance**: Optimized CPU performance on Intel Macs.

## 🛠️ Building From Source

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows that automatically build whisper.cpp binaries.

### Automatic Builds

Builds are triggered:
1. **Tag-based releases**: Push a tag starting with `v*` (e.g., `v1.8.2`)
2. **Manual workflow dispatch**: Trigger builds manually from the Actions tab

### Manual Build Trigger

To trigger a build manually:

1. Go to the [Actions](https://github.com/bizenlabs/whisper-cpp-macos-bin/actions) tab
2. Select "Build and Release whisper.cpp macOS Binaries"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter:
   - **whisper.cpp version**: The version/tag from [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) to build (e.g., `v1.8.2`, `master`)
   - **Release tag**: The tag for this release in your repo (e.g., `v1.8.2-1`)
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Build Matrix

The workflow builds two configurations in parallel:

| Configuration | OS | Architecture | GPU Support | Optimizations |
|--------------|-----|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| macOS ARM64 (Metal) | macOS 14 (Sonoma) | arm64 | Metal GPU | ARM NEON, Accelerate |
| macOS x86_64 (Accelerate) | macOS 14 (cross-compile) | x86_64 | None (CPU) | AVX/AVX2, Accelerate |

## 🔍 Verifying Downloads

Each release includes SHA256 checksums. Verify your download:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c whisper-cpp-*.tar.gz.sha256
```

## 🎯 Available Tools

### Core Tools (Both ARM64 and x86_64)
- **whisper-cli** - Command-line transcription tool
- **whisper-bench** - Performance benchmarking
- **whisper-server** - HTTP API server with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **whisper-quantize** - Model quantization tool
- And more...

### ARM64-Only Tools
- **whisper-stream** - Real-time audio transcription from microphone (requires SDL2)
- **whisper-command** - Voice command example (requires SDL2)

> **Note**: The x86_64 build excludes SDL2-dependent tools due to cross-compilation constraints. For real-time streaming on Intel Macs, consider using the command-line tools with audio file input instead.

## ⚡ Performance Tips

### For Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Use the ARM64 build with Metal GPU support
- Metal acceleration is enabled by default - no additional flags needed
- For best performance, ensure your Mac is not in low-power mode

### For Intel Macs
- Use the x86_64 build with Accelerate framework
- Consider using smaller models (tiny, base) for real-time applications
- Use the `-t` flag to specify the number of CPU threads

### General Tips
- Use quantized models (Q5_0, Q5_1) for reduced memory usage
- Enable Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for faster processing of long files
- Use smaller models for faster inference if accuracy permits
